  "The walled and gated McGrath estate was a world unto itself, protected and private.",
  "On this twilit evening, the Tudor-style home’s mullioned windows glowed jewel-like amid the lush, landscaped grounds.",
  "Palm fronds swayed overhead; candles floated on the surface of the pool and golden lanterns hung from the branches of a large California live oak.",
  "Black-clad servers moved among the well-dressed crowd, carrying silver trays full of champagne, while a jazz trio played softly in the corner.",
  "",
  "Twenty-year-old Frances Grace McGrath knew what was expected of her tonight.",
  "She was to be the very portrait of a well-bred young lady, smiling and serene; any untoward emotions were to be contained and concealed, borne in silence.",
  "The lessons Frankie had been taught at home and at church and at St. Bernadette’s Academy for Girls had instilled in her a rigorous sense of propriety.",
  "The unrest going on across the country these days, erupting on city streets and college campuses, was a distant and alien world to her, as incomprehensible as the conflict in faraway Vietnam.",
  "",
  "She circulated among the guests, sipping an ice-cold Coca-Cola, trying to smile, stopping now and then to make small talk with her parents’ friends, hoping her worry didn’t show.",
  "All the while, her gaze searched the crowd for her brother, who was late to his own party.",
  "",
  "Frankie idolized her older brother, Finley.",
  "They’d always been inseparable, a pair of black-haired, blue-eyed kids, less than two years apart in age, who’d spent the long California summers unsupervised by adults, riding their bikes from one end of sleepy Coronado Island to the other, rarely coming home before nightfall.",
  "",
  "But now he was going where she couldn’t follow.",
  "",
  "The roar of a car engine disturbed the quiet party; car horns honked loudly, in succession.",
  "",
  "Frankie saw how her mother flinched at the noise.",
  "Bette McGrath hated anything showy or vulgar, and she certainly didn’t believe in announcing one’s presence by honking a horn.",
  "",
  "Moments later, Finley banged through the back gate, his handsome face flushed, a lock of curly black hair fallen across his forehead.",
  "His best friend, Rye Walsh, had an arm around him, but neither looked too steady on his feet.",
  "They laughed drunkenly, held each other up, as more of their friends stumbled into the party behind them.",
  "",
  "Dressed impeccably in a black sheath, with her hair in a regal updo, Mom moved toward the group of laughing young men and women.",
  "She wore the pearls her grandmother had bequeathed her, a subtle reminder that Bette McGrath had once been Bette Alexander, of the Newport Beach Alexanders.",
  "“Boys,” she said in her modulated charm-school voice.",
  "“How nice that you are finally here.”",
  "",
  "Finley stumbled away from Rye, tried to straighten.",
  "",
  "Dad motioned to the band and the music stopped.",
  "Suddenly the sounds of Coronado Island on a late spring night—the throaty purr of the ocean, the whisper of the palm fronds overhead, a dog barking down the street or on the beach—took over.",
  "Dad strode forward in his custom-made black suit, crisp white shirt, and black tie, holding a cigarette in one hand and a Manhattan in his other.",
  "With his close-cropped black hair and square jaw, he looked a little like an ex-boxer who’d hit the big time and learned how to dress well, which wasn’t too far off.",
  "Even among this handsome, well-dressed crowd, he and Mom stood out, radiated success.",
  "She was old money and had always been at the top of the social ladder; he had climbed his way up to stand confidently beside her.",
  "",
  "“Friends, family, recent academy graduates,” Dad said in his booming voice.",
  "When Frankie was young, he’d still had a hint of an Irish accent, which he’d worked hard to eliminate.",
  "He often touted his own immigrant mythology, a story of bootstrapping and hard work.",
  "He rarely mentioned the good fortune and opportunity that had come with marrying the boss’s daughter, but everyone knew.",
  "They also knew that after the death of Mom’s parents, Dad had more than tripled their wealth with his zeal for developing California real estate.",
  "",
  "He put an arm around his slender wife, drew her as close as she would allow in public.",
  "“We are grateful that you have come to help us say bon voyage to our son, Finley.”",
  "Dad smiled.",
  "“No more bailing him out of the Coronado police station at two A.M. after some ridiculous drag race.”",
  "",
  "There was a smattering of laughter.",
  "Everyone at this party knew the circuitous track Finley had taken to adulthood.",
  "From earliest memory, he had been a golden boy, a wild child who could make the hardest heart soften.",
  "People laughed at his jokes; girls followed him everywhere.",
  "Everyone loved Finley, but most agreed that he was a handful.",
  "He had been held back in fourth grade, more for constant mischievousness than anything else.",
  "He was sometimes disrespectful in church, and he liked the kind of girl who wore short skirts and carried cigarettes in her purse.",
  "",
  "When the laughter ended, Dad went on: “A toast to Finley and his grand adventure.",
  "We are proud of you, son!”",
  "",
  "Servers appeared with bottles of Dom Pérignon and poured more champagne; the tinkling sound of glass on glass filled the air.",
  "Guests surrounded Finley; men clapped him on the back in congratulations.",
  "Young women pressed forward, vying for his attention.",
  "",
  "Dad motioned to the band, and music started up again.",
  "",
  "Feeling left out, Frankie headed into the house, past the large kitchen, where the caterers were busily putting canapés on trays.",
  "",
  "She ducked into her father’s office.",
  "It had been her favorite place as a child.",
  "Big tufted leather chairs, footstools, two walls of books, a massive desk.",
  "She flicked on the light.",
  "The room smelled of old leather and cigars, with a hint of expensive aftershave.",
  "Neatly organized stacks of building permits and architectural plans lay atop the desk.",
  "",
  "One entire wall of the office was devoted to their family history.",
  "Framed photographs Mom had inherited from her parents and even a few Dad had brought with him from Ireland.",
  "There was a photo of Great-Grandfather McGrath, in his soldier’s uniform, saluting the camera.",
  "Alongside that photograph was a framed war medal that her Grandpa Francis had been awarded in the First World War.",
  "The photograph of her parents’ wedding was positioned between her grandfather Alexander’s framed Purple Heart and a newspaper clipping with a photo of the ship he’d served on coming into harbor at the end of the war.",
  "There were no photographs of her father in uniform.",
  "To his great shame, he had been labeled 4-F and disqualified for military service.",
  "It was something he lamented in private, only to family, and only when he’d been drinking.",
  "After the war, he’d convinced Grandpa Alexander to begin building affordable housing in San Diego for returning veterans.",
  "Dad called it his contribution to the war effort, and it had been spectacularly successful.",
  "In conversation, he was always so “military-proud” that, in time, everyone on Coronado seemed to forget he hadn’t served.",
  "There were no photographs of his children, not yet.",
  "Her father believed that one had to earn their way onto this wall.",
  "",
  "Frankie heard the door open quietly behind her, and someone said, “Oh.",
  "I’m sorry.",
  "I don’t mean to intrude.”",
  "",
  "She turned and saw Rye Walsh standing in the doorway.",
  "He held a cocktail in one hand and a pack of Old Gold cigarettes in the other.",
  "No doubt he’d been looking for a quiet place to smoke.",

  "“I’m hiding from the party,” she said.",
  "“I don’t feel much like celebrating, it seems.”",

  "He left the door open behind him.",
  "“I was doing the same thing, I guess.",
  "You probably don’t remember me—”",
  "",
  "“Joseph Ryerson Walsh; goes by Rye.",
  "Like the whiskey,” Frankie said, trying to smile.",
  "It was how he’d introduced himself to her last summer.",
  "“Why are you hiding out?",
  "You and Fin are thick as thieves.",
  "You both love a good party.”",
  "",
  "As he neared, her heart did a queer little stutter.",
  "He’d had that effect on her from their first meeting, but they’d never really spoken.",
  "She didn’t know what to say to him now, when she felt a little bereft.",
  "Lonely.",
  "",
  "“I’m going to miss him,” he said quietly.",
  "",
  "She felt the sting of tears and turned quickly away, faced the wall of memorabilia; he moved in beside her.",
  "They stared up at the family photos and mementos.",
  "Men in uniforms, women in wedding dresses, medals for valor and injury, a triangle-folded and framed American flag that had been given to her paternal grandmother.",
  "",
  "“How come there are no pictures of women up here, except for the wedding pictures?”",
  "Rye asked.",
  "",
  "“It’s a heroes’ wall.",
  "To honor the sacrifices our family has made in service of the country.”",
  "",
  "He lit a cigarette.",
  "“Women can be heroes.”",
  "",
  "Frankie laughed.",
  "",
  "“What’s funny about that?”",
  "",
  "She turned to him, wiped the tears from her eyes.",
  "“I … well … you don’t mean…”",
  "",
  "“Yeah,” he said, looking down at her.",
  "She couldn’t remember a man ever looking at her in such a way, so intensely.",
  "It made her catch her breath.",
  "“I mean it, Frankie.",
  "It’s 1966.",
  "The whole world is changing.”",
  "",
  "- - -",
  "",
  "Hours later, when the guests had begun to make their polite exits, Frankie found herself still thinking about Rye, and what he’d said.",
  "",
  "Women can be heroes.",
  "",
  "No one had ever said such a thing to her.",
  "Not her teachers at St. Bernadette’s, not her parents.",
  "Not even Finley.",
  "Why had it never occurred to Frankie that a girl, a woman, could have a place on her father’s office wall for doing something heroic or important, that a woman could invent something or discover something or be a nurse on the battlefield, could literally save lives?",
  "",
  "The idea of it was like an earthquake, an upending of her sheltered view of the world, of herself.",
  "She’d been told for years, by the nuns, by her teachers, by her mother, that nursing was an excellent profession for a woman.",
  "",
  "Teacher.",
  "Nurse.",
  "Secretary.",
  "These were acceptable futures for a girl like her.",
  "Only last week her mother had listened to Frankie talk about her struggles in upper-level biology and said gently, Who cares about frogs, Frances?",
  "You’re only going to be a nurse until you get married.",
  "And by the way, it’s time you start thinking about that.",
  "Quit rushing through your classes and slow down.",
  "Who cares if you graduate early?",
  "You need to date more.",
  "Frankie had been taught to believe that her job was to be a good housewife, to raise well-mannered children and keep a lovely home.",
  "In her Catholic high school, they’d spent days learning how to iron buttonholes to perfection, how to precisely fold a napkin, how to set an elegant table.",
  "At the San Diego College for Women, there wasn’t much rebellion among her classmates and friends.",
  "Girls laughed about working for their MRS degree.",
  "Even her own choice of nursing as a degree hadn’t required much introspection; all she’d really focused on was getting good grades and making her parents proud.",
  "",
  "As the musicians packed up their instruments and the waiters began clearing away the empty glasses, Frankie flipped off her sandals and left the yard and wandered across empty Ocean Boulevard, the wide, paved street that separated her parents’ house from the beach.",
  "",
  "The golden sand of Coronado Beach stretched out in front of her.",
  "Off to the left was the famous Hotel del Coronado and to the right was the large Naval Air Station North Island, which had recently been recognized as the Birthplace of Naval Aviation.",
  "",
  "A cool night breeze plucked at her bouffant chin-length bob, but it was no match for the layer of Aqua Net that kept every strand in place.",
  "",
  "She sat down in the cool sand, looped her arms around her bent knees, and stared out at the waves.",
  "A full moon hung overhead.",
  "Not far away, a beach bonfire glowed orange; the smell of smoke drifted on the night air.",
  "",
  "How did a woman go about opening up her world?",
  "How did one begin a journey when no invitation had been issued?",
  "It was easy for Finley; the path had been laid out for him.",
  "He was to do what all the McGrath and Alexander men did: serve his country with honor and then take over the family real estate business.",
  "No one had ever suggested any future for Frankie beyond marriage and motherhood.",
  "",
  "She heard laughter behind her, the sound of running feet.",
  "A young blond woman took off her shoes at the water’s edge and splashed into the surf.",
  "Rye followed her, laughing, not even bothering to take off his shoes.",
  "Someone sang “Walk Like a Man” off-key.",
  "",
  "Finley plopped down beside Frankie, fell drunkenly into her.",
  "“Where have you been all night, doll?",
  "I missed you.”",
  "",
  "“Hey, Fin,” she said quietly.",
  "Leaning into him, she remembered their lives on this beach; as children, they’d built elaborate sandcastles and bought Creamsicles from the jangling ice-cream truck that drove up and down Ocean Boulevard in the summer.",
  "They’d spent long hours on their surfboards, feet dangling over the sides, talking beneath the hot sun as they waited for the right wave, sharing their deepest secrets.",
  "",
  "Together, always.",
  "Best friends.",
  "",
  "She knew what he needed from her now; she should tell Fin she was proud of him and send him off with a smile, but she couldn’t do it.",
  "They’d never lied to each other.",
  "It didn’t seem like the time to start.",
  "“Fin, are you sure you should go to Vietnam?”",
  "",
  "“Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”",

  "Frankie sighed.",
  "She and Finley had idolized President Kennedy.",
  "His words meant something to them, so how could she argue?",
  "“I know, but—”",
  "",
  "“It isn’t dangerous, Frankie.",
  "Trust me.",
  "I’m a Naval Academy graduate, an officer with a cushy assignment on a ship.",
  "I’ll be back in no time.",
  "You’ll hardly have time to miss me.”",

  "Everyone said the same thing: Communism was an evil that had to be stopped; these were the Cold War years.",
  "Dangerous times.",
  "If a great man like President Kennedy could be shot in broad daylight by a Red in Dallas, how could any American feel safe?",
  "Everyone agreed that communism couldn’t be allowed to flourish in Asia, and Vietnam was the place to stop it.",

  "Pada senja yang temaram ini, jendela-jendela berbingkai rumah bergaya Tudor itu berkilau laksana permata di tengah pekarangan yang rimbun dan asri.",
  "Pelepah palem melambai di atas kepala; lilin-lilin terapung di permukaan kolam renang dan lentera keemasan menggantung di dahan-dahan pohon live oak California yang besar.",
  "Para pelayan berbusana serba hitam bergerak di antara kerumunan tamu yang berpakaian necis, membawa nampan perak penuh gelas sampanye, sementara trio jazz bermain lembut di sudut.",
  "",
  "Frances Grace McGrath, dua puluh tahun, tahu betul apa yang diharapkan darinya malam ini.",
  "Ia harus menjadi potret sempurna seorang gadis terhormat, tersenyum dan tenang; segala emosi yang tak pantas harus diredam dan disembunyikan, ditanggung dalam diam.",
  "Pelajaran yang diterima Frankie di rumah, di gereja, dan di Akademi Putri St. Bernadette telah menanamkan rasa kepatutan yang ketat dalam dirinya.",
  "Gejolak yang melanda negeri belakangan ini, yang meletup di jalanan kota dan kampus-kampus, adalah dunia yang jauh dan asing baginya, sama sulit dipahaminya dengan konflik di Vietnam yang nun jauh di sana.",
  "",
  "Ia berbaur di antara para tamu, menyesap Coca-Cola dingin, berusaha tersenyum, berhenti sesekali untuk berbasa-basi dengan teman-teman orang tuanya, berharap kecemasannya tidak terlihat.",
  "Sepanjang waktu, tatapannya menyisir kerumunan mencari kakaknya, yang terlambat datang ke pestanya sendiri.",
  "",
  "Frankie memuja kakak laki-lakinya, Finley.",
  "Mereka tak terpisahkan sejak dulu, sepasang bocah berambut hitam dan bermata biru, terpaut usia kurang dari dua tahun, yang menghabiskan musim panas panjang California tanpa pengawasan orang dewasa, mengayuh sepeda dari ujung ke ujung Pulau Coronado yang senyap, dan jarang pulang sebelum malam turun.",
  "",
  "Namun kini, kakaknya akan pergi ke tempat yang tak bisa ia ikuti.",
  "",
  "Deru mesin mobil memecah ketenangan pesta; klakson berbunyi nyaring, bertalu-talu.",
  "",
  "Frankie melihat ibunya tersentak mendengar suara itu.",
  "Bette McGrath membenci segala sesuatu yang mencolok atau norak, dan ia jelas tidak setuju dengan cara mengumumkan kedatangan dengan membunyikan klakson.",

  "Beberapa saat kemudian, Finley menerobos gerbang belakang dengan berisik, wajah tampannya memerah, seuntai rambut hitam ikal jatuh di dahinya.",
  "Sahabatnya, Rye Walsh, merangkul bahunya, namun keduanya tampak sempoyongan.",
  "Mereka tertawa mabuk, saling menopang, sementara teman-teman mereka yang lain berjalan terhuyung-huyung masuk ke pesta di belakang mereka.",

  "Ayah melangkah maju dengan setelan jas hitam jahitan khusus, kemeja putih kaku, dan dasi hitam, memegang rokok di satu tangan dan segelas Manhattan di tangan lainnya.",
  "Dengan rambut hitam cepak dan rahang persegi, ia sedikit mirip mantan petinju yang sukses besar dan belajar cara berpakaian necis—yang sebenarnya tak jauh dari kenyataan.",
  "Bahkan di tengah kerumunan yang tampan dan berpakaian rapi ini, ia dan Ibu tampak menonjol, memancarkan aura kesuksesan.",
  "Ibu berasal dari keluarga kaya lama dan selalu berada di puncak tangga sosial; Ayah telah meniti jalan ke atas untuk berdiri dengan percaya diri di sampingnya.",

  "Orang-orang menertawakan leluconnya; para gadis mengikutinya ke mana-mana.",
  "Semua orang menyukai Finley, tapi sebagian besar setuju bahwa ia sulit diatur.",

  "Housed in a Quonset hut near the OR, the Neuro ward was a brightly lit, domed space filled with Stryker frame beds.",
  "Frankie had never seen the specialized beds before, but she’d learned about them in school and in Basic Training: beds for paraplegics, for patients with pelvic fractures, burn patients, or others who couldn’t handle much manipulation.",
  "Two rows of beds were separated by a wide aisle.",
  "Metal tubing ran the length of each wall for hanging IVs.",
  "The amount of equipment at each bed was staggering: ventilators, cooling blankets, monitors, IVs.",
  "Frankie didn’t even recognize most of the machines.",

  "The relative quiet of the Neuro ward was the perfect place for Frankie to improve her nursing skills.",
  "She was able to breathe here, to concentrate, to ask questions of Captain Smith, and with practice came the start of confidence.",
  "There were few emergencies on this ward; the patients’ wounds had already been cared for in the OR.",
  "The patients were comatose, but most had other wounds that needed care, too.",
  "The quiet gave her time to think, to process, to read the detailed care notes she wrote after checking each patient.",
  "The job at the Thirty-Sixth Evac was to get the patients stable enough to go to a field hospital for treatment.",
  "Pain management was the task Frankie took the most seriously.",
  "Because her patients couldn’t speak, she took extra care with each one to assess—and assume—their pain levels.",
  "",
  "From a distance, the ward seemed to be full of young men stuck in the hinterland between life and death.",
  "Most had little or no reaction to any stimulus, but as Frankie learned the skills it took to care for these men, she began to see them not merely as bodies in pain, but as men hoping for something more.",
  "Each soldier made her think of Finley.",
  "She spoke to them softly, touched their hands.",
  "She imagined each patient lying here, locked in the black void of a coma, dreaming of home.",
  "",
  "Now she stood at the bedside of nineteen-year-old Private Jorge Ruiz, a radio operator who had saved most of his platoon.",
  "Captain Smith had placed him in the back of the ward, which meant that he wasn’t expected to live long enough for transfer.",

  "“Hey, Private,” Frankie said, leaning down close, whispering directly into his ear.",
  "“I’m Frankie McGrath.",
  "I’m one of your nurses.”",

  "She pulled a stainless steel cart closer.",
  "It was stocked with sterile gauze, peroxide, and adhesive tape.",
  "She’d need to replenish it all for the shift change.",
  "The overhead lights blared down on her, making her eyes ache.",
  "",
  "She reached gently for his leg, wondering if he had any sensation of being touched as she unwrapped the bloodstained gauze.",
  "",
  "“This might hurt,” she said gently as she began to pick at the crusty, dried gauze, pulling it out of the pink, jagged wound.",
  "She wished she could dampen the gauze to make it free easier, but this way the wound bled, and bleeding was good.",
  "",
  "Beneath the gauze, she looked for blackened bits of tissue or green pockets of pus.",
  "She leaned forward to smell the wound.",
  "",
  "All normal.",
  "No infection.",
  "",
  "“Looking good, Private Ruiz.",
  "A lot of the boys in this room would be envious of a healing like that,” she said as she re-bandaged the wound.",
  "",
  "Beside her, the ventilator rose and fell, whooshed and thunked, inflating and deflating his sunken chest.",
  "",
  "A commotion at the doors interrupted the quiet.",
  "Two bloodied soldiers in dirty, ripped fatigues walked into the ward, shoulder to shoulder.",

  "Could we take a picture of you with him?",
  "For his mama?”",

  "The soldier snapped the shot.",

  "“He’s lucky to have friends like you,” Frankie said.",

  "By the end of her long night shift, it was all she could do to stand upright.",
  "With barely a glance at Debbie John, the nurse who’d come in to replace her, Frankie stumbled out of the ward.",
  "It was early in the morning and already the sun beat down on her.",
  "She bypassed the mess hall—not hungry—and the O Club—no desire to party—and headed to her hooch.",

  "Men were throwing a football back and forth as a water truck rolled past.",

  "Ethel and Barbara led the way to a two-and-a-half-ton truck—a deuce and a half—that was parked near the gates of the hospital.",

  "Was it safe out here?",
  "“The Medical Civic Action Program.",
  "We provide medical care to locals.",
  "I’m sure you’ve seen them in the wards.",
  "Captain Smith organizes these outings whenever he can, says they remind him of his practice back home.”",

  "They drove through a village that was not far from the hospital compound, saw fatigues and uniforms and olive-green T-shirts hanging from laundry lines.",
  "And then they were out in the country, jungle to the left, dirty brown river to the right.",
  "A bunch of kids floated downstream on a tire, laughing and shoving each other.",
  "",
  "Frankie used her Polaroid and snapped a photograph of a young boy herding a black water buffalo along the water, and one of an old woman dressed traditionally in a long, split tunic over slim pants, which Frankie had learned was called an ao dai, carrying a woven basket full of fruit.",

  "Frankie stared out at the jungle, lowering her Polaroid camera to her lap.",
  "A team of enemy shooters could be hiding out there.",
  "She imagined men squatted behind stands of elephant grass, their guns pointed at the truck.",
  "She scrunched down, held the hat on her head, started to sweat.",
  "",
  "The truck rumbled down a muddy, potholed road and through the green countryside.",
  "Evidence of war was everywhere—burn scars on the land, sandbags, rows of concertina wire, explosions sounding in the distance, choppers flying overhead.",
  "In a huge patch of jungle, leaves were dying and had turned orange; Frankie knew it meant that the U.S. had sprayed the area with an herbicide, Agent Orange, to kill the vegetation and limit the enemy’s ability to hide.",
  "",
  "She saw Vietnamese women moving through the rice paddies or walking in the tall grass, wearing their flowing ao dais and conical straw hats, carrying babies and toddlers as they worked beneath the hot sun.",
  "",
  "They drove upward onto a mountain and, at last, came to a village tucked on a small, flat plain cut into the lush hillside.",
  "Neat gardens were carefully fenced and homes built of bamboo stood on stilts.",
  "In this remote village, the people lived as their ancestors had—hunting with crossbows and rice-farming.",
  "",
  "The village appeared to have been built around a beautiful, but decaying, stone building, a relic of Vietnam’s contentious French-occupation past.",
  "The villagers—mostly small, hunched-over old men and women with thin necks and narrow wrists, their teeth blackened by constant chewing of betel seeds—came out from their huts to stand in front of the deuce and a half in a straight line, their hands clasped, their heads bowed respectfully.",

  "How did you know who was an enemy and who was an ally?",
  "",
  "She took a hard look at the line of villagers, in their flimsy black clothes, noticing there were no young people, male or female; only the very old and the young children.",

  "She nodded as he walked toward an elderly man, who was no taller than a ten-year-old American boy, with dark skin and black teeth.",
  "He smiled at the medical team; deep lines crinkled his face.",
  "He drew them toward him with a crooked finger, then turned and led them up into the broken-down French villa.",
  "The stone walls were riddled with bullet holes; in several rooms the walls had crumbled.",
  "Woven grasslike mats lay on the floor.",
  "A fire glowed in a large fireplace.",
  "In it, a black pot bubbled and popped, sending a rich scent of spices into the dank room.",

  "Frankie smiled back uncertainly, took another sip.",

  "After the welcoming ritual, the team set up stations to help the villagers.",
  "Everything was communicated by hand signals.",
  "None of the villagers spoke a word of English.",
  "The medical team set up a makeshift clinic with a portable exam table in a bare hut with a thatched roof; another table was set up outside with a tub full of soapy water for scrubbing lice out of children’s hair and washing sores on their skin.",
  "Flies landed on everything, on hair, on lips, on hands.",
  "The driver of the truck handed out candy to the children, who gathered around him, clamoring for more.",

  "She checked teeth and looked in ear canals and listened to heartbeats.",
  "She was nearly at the end of her line of villagers when a small boy, not more than five, sneaked in to stand beside her.",

  "She was constantly scratching and sweating.",

  "In the hooch, she found Ethel and Barb dressed in civilian clothes—Ethel in a summery dress she’d had made by a Vietnamese woman in Saigon, and Barb in a custom-made black silk ao dai.",
  "",
  "Frankie saw her dress laid out on her bed, the one she’d bought at Bullock’s: a pretty blue sheath with a Peter Pan collar and matching belt.",

  "He’d shown Frankie kindness and patience in teaching her the skills needed to care for the patients in Neuro.",
  "She had spent countless hours with him in the ward, even shared a Coke with him a time or two in the O Club.",

  "“That’s our ride?”",
  "Frankie said, frowning as they approached the helipad.",
  "Choppers might be big and maneuverable, but they were targets, too.",
  "The enemy loved to shoot them out of the sky, and when a chopper exploded midair, there were often no remains to be found.",
  "She knew that too well.",
  "",
  "Hot air whooshed from the rotors, whipped up dirt, stung her eyes.",

  "Ethel shoved Frankie forward; a soldier swung her into the chopper.",
  "Frankie scrambled for the back, took a seat, and pressed herself against the wall.",
  "",
  "Barb and Ethel each sat in one of the open doorframes, their feet swinging over the edge, laughing as the helicopter rose into the air and shot forward, nose down, tail up.",
  "",
  "The noise inside the chopper was earsplitting.",
  "",
  "As they banked left, Frankie saw Vietnam through the open doorway: The flat green swath of jungle, a brown ribbon of water, dotted with boats.",
  "White sand beaches bordered the turquoise waters of the South China Sea.",
  "Verdant mountains in the distance reached up into the blue cloud-strewn sky.",
  "",
  "There was destruction, too.",
  "Concertina wire that caught the light and sent it back in a thousand glints of color.",
  "Giant red holes in the earth, trees fallen or cut down.",
  "Scrap metal heaps strewn along roads.",
  "Helicopters swooping across the landscape, firing at the ground, being fired on.",
  "The constant whir of their rotors, the pop-pop-pop of mortar attacks.",
  "Tanks rolling on dirt roads, throwing up red clouds of dust.",
  "These days, the U.S. constantly bombed the Ho Chi Minh Trail.",
  "Up in the mountains near a village called Pleiku, there was fighting.",
  "",
  "“That’s Long Binh,” one of the gunners yelled.",
  "",
  "Long Binh, Frankie knew, was one of the largest bases in-country.",
  "Tens of thousands of people lived and worked there.",
  "She’d heard that the PX on base was bigger than any department store back home.",
  "From above, it was a sprawling city carved out of the jungle, built on a flat red rectangle of dirt.",
  "Bulldozers bit at the edges, constantly making more room.",
  "There wasn’t a blade of grass or a tree to be seen, nothing green, no patch of shade left from the jungle they’d torn down to build their temporary city.",
  "",
  "They touched down on the helipad just as sunset turned the sky a brilliant, blazing red.",
  "",
  "Frankie angled cautiously forward, edged out of the chopper, and followed Ethel and Barb, who knew exactly where they were going in the dirty, smelly confusion of roads and people and tanks and bulldozers.",
  "The place was a hive of activity; a huge hospital was being built to house the rising number of wounded.",
  "",
  "The Officers’ Club at Long Binh was legendary.",
  "Frankie had heard stories of epic parties and fall-down-drunk fests, even of the MPs being called on occasion.",
  "Captain Smith—who’d been in Long Binh for most of his first tour—still spoke often of the club, and said he wouldn’t want a going-away party to be held anywhere else.",
  "",
  "Barb reached the O Club first and opened the door.",
  "Frankie moved in beside her.",
  "She felt conspicuous in her ridiculously conservative blue dress, with her nails bitten down to the quick and her black pixie cut grown so shaggy she looked like one of the Beatles.",
  "The headscarf she’d tied over it did little to help.",
  "At least she had sneakers now, instead of just her boots.",
  "",
  "The Officers’ Club was not what she’d expected.",
  "But what had she expected?",
  "White linen tablecloths and waiters in black, like the country club on Coronado Island?",
  "",
  "In fact, it was just a dark, seedy bar.",
  "The stifling-hot air smelled of cigarette smoke and spilled booze and sweat.",
  "",
  "A wooden bar ran the length of the building; a line of men were bellied up to it.",
  "More sat clustered around wooden tables in mismatched chairs.",
  "There weren’t many women here, but the few that were here were on the dance floor.",
  "She saw Kathy Mohr, one of the surgical nurses from the Thirty-Sixth, dancing with Captain Smith.",
  "A banner had been strung above the bar.",
  "It read BON VOYAGE, CPT SMITH.",
  "",
  "Frankie was reminded suddenly of the catered party her parents had thrown to celebrate Finley going to war.",
  "",
  "It felt like another world ago, another time.",
  "",
  "Appallingly naive.",
  "",
  "Barb dragged Frankie through the clot of men, elbowing her way.",
  "At the bar, she ordered a gin and tonic and two sodas, yelling to be heard over the din of voices and music.",
  "A soldier stood beside her, smiling wolfishly, thrilled to see two American women.",
  "Frankie saw the Big Red One patch on his sleeve, for the First Infantry.",
  "",
  "Barb ignored the man and carried the three drinks toward an empty table.",
  "The music changed, became sexy.",
  "A song Frankie hadn’t heard before.",
  "“Come on, baby, light my fire.”",

  "Frankie was about to make her way to the table when someone touched her arm.",
  "",
  "Dr. Jamie Callahan stood there, smiling.",
  "She remembered how he’d helped her through her first red alert, how steadying his voice had been, the kindness he’d shown her, and the night they’d talked by the latrines.",
  "She’d seen him once or twice in the mess hall or the O Club since she’d been promoted to days, but they’d not talked much.",
  "",
  "Tonight, in his white T-shirt and fatigues and combat boots, he was Robert Redford in This Property Is Condemned good-looking.",
  "And he knew it.",
  "Dirty-blond hair, grown longer than regulation allowed, blue eyes, square jaw.",
  "Anyone would have called him the American boy next door, and yet there was sadness in his eyes, a slight sag to his shoulders.",
  "She sensed a despair in him that lay just below the surface.",
  "Grief.",
  "Perhaps he saw it in her, too.",
  "",
  "“It’s a party now that the nurses have arrived,” he said, giving her a strained smile.",
  "",
  "She met his gaze.",
  "The weeks she’d spent studying comatose patients had sharpened her observation skills.",
  "“Are you okay?”",
  "",
  "The music changed.",
  "Percy Sledge’s soulful “When a Man Loves a Woman” filled the room.",
  "",
  "“Dance with me, McGrath,” he said.",
  "It wasn’t a cocky, I’m-so-cool-and-you’ll-be-swept-away request, not what she would have expected.",
  "That kind of thing she would have laughed at.",
  "",
  "This was a man’s plea, tinged with desperation and loneliness.",
  "",
  "She knew that feeling well.",
  "She felt it during every shift as she moved among her comatose patients, hoping for miracles.",
  "",
  "She reached for his hand.",
  "He led her out onto the dance floor.",
  "She fit up against him, felt the solid strength of him, and realized suddenly, sharply, how lonely she was, too.",
  "And not just here in Vietnam, but ever since Finley’s death.",
  "",
  "She rested her cheek on his collarbone.",
  "They moved in an easy, familiar rhythm, changing their steps only when the music changed.",
  "",
  "Finally, she looked up, found him looking down at her.",
  "She reached up slowly, eased the hair out of his eyes.",
  "“You look tired.”",
  "",
  "“Rough day.”",
  "",
  "He tried to smile, and the effort touched her.",
  "She knew how hard that particular camouflage could be.",
  "",
  "“They’re so young,” he said.",
  "",
  "“Tell me something good,” she said.",
  "",
  "He thought for a minute, smiled.",
  "“My seven-year-old niece, Kaylee, lost a tooth.",
  "The tooth fairy left her fifty cents and she bought a goldfish.",
  "Her brother, Braden, made the soccer team.”",
  "",
  "Frankie smiled at the sweetness of it.",
  "She was about to ask him something about his life back in the world when the door to the O Club burst open, letting in the sound of a distant mortar attack.",
  "A trio of men walked in.",
  "",
  "Strode, really.",
  "They were noticeable, loud, laughing.",
  "They didn’t look military, let alone like officers.",
  "All three had hair that was too long to be regulation.",
  "Two had mustaches.",
  "One wore a cowboy hat and a Warlocks T-shirt.",
  "Only one wore the blue fatigues of the Navy.",
  "They had their arms around each other’s shoulders and were singing what sounded like a fight song.",
  "",
  "They pushed through the crowd and sat at a table that bore a RESERVED sign.",
  "One of them raised a hand and a Vietnamese waitress wearing an ao dai rushed over with a bottle of Jack Daniel’s and three shot glasses on a tray.",
  "A smaller guy with reddish hair and a sparse mustache threw his head back and howled like a wolf.",
  "",
  "“Who are they?”",
  "Frankie asked.",
  "They looked more like Berkeley students or cowboys than naval officers.",
  "",
  "“New squadron.",
  "The Seawolves.",
  "Naval helicopter combat support.",
  "The Navy needed bird pilots, so last year they chose a few jet jockeys, asked for volunteers, and taught them to fly choppers.",
  "They may look arrogant and unchecked with their hair and clothing, but they’re workhorses.",
  "They’ve flown a lot of medevacs for us in their off-hours.",
  "You call on one of the Seawolves, and if they aren’t fighting Victor Charlie, they show up.”",
  "He fell silent for a moment, then said, “I’ve been thinking about you, McGrath.”",
  "",
  "Now he sounded and looked like any other on-the-make surgeon.",
  "This man she could laugh at.",
  "“Really?”",
  "",
  "“You’ve been hiding long enough.”",
  "",
  "“Hiding?”",
  "",
  "“In Neuro.",
  "Your girl squad—Ethel and Barb—tell me you’re ready to move up.”",
  "",
  "“Oh.”",
  "",
  "“Captain Smith says you did exceptional work.",
  "Fastest learner he’s ever had, he said.”",
  "",
  "Frankie didn’t quite know how to respond.",
  "Captain Smith had never said that to her.",
  "",
  "“He also says you are compassionate, which I already knew.”",
  "",
  "“Well…”",
  "",
  "“The point is this.",
  "Did you come to this hellhole to change bandages or to save lives?”",
  "",
  "“Well.",
  "I don’t think that’s quite fair, sir.”",
  "",
  "“Jamie,” he said.",
  "“For God’s sake, McGrath.",
  "Jamie.”",

  "“So.",
  "Jamie.",
  "I don’t think that’s quite fair.",
  "An opportunistic infection can—”",
  "",
  "“Come work in surgery with me.",
  "Patty Perkins is a short-timer.",
  "I need someone good to replace her.”",
  "",
  "“I’m not good enough,” she said.",
  "“Take Sara from the burn unit.”",
  "",
  "“I want you, McGrath.”",
  "",
  "She heard more in that sentence than belonged there, enough heat to set off warning bells.",
  "“If this is just a way to sleep with me—”",
  "",
  "He gave her an easy smile.",
  "“Oh, I’d love to sleep with you, McGrath, but that’s not what this is about.”",
  "",
  "“I’m not good enough.",
  "Honestly.”",
  "",
  "“You will be when I get done with you.",
  "Scout’s honor.”",
  "",
  "“Were you ever a Scout?”",
  "",
  "“Hell, no.",
  "I still can’t figure out what I’m doing here.",
  "Too much debt and too many war stories, I think.",
  "My dad told me I was a fool.",
  "But here I am and here I’ll be for another seven months.",
  "I need a kick-ass nurse at my side.”",
  "",
  "Frankie was afraid of all of it—mass casualties, failing at her job, keeping Jamie at bay—but she’d been here almost two months and, as bad as it was, time was moving fast.",
  "She’d learned what she could from Neuro.",
  "If she really loved nursing and wanted to be even better, it was time to take the next step.",
  "",
  "“Okay, Captain Callahan.",
  "I’ll put in for a transfer to surgery.”",
  "",
  "“Excellent.”",
  "He looked very pleased with himself.",
  "There was a glimmer in his eyes that Frankie assumed had seduced plenty of women.",
  "She did not intend to fall prey; but the truth was that he tempted her.",
  "And she was pretty sure he knew it.",

  "In the past month, they’d spent more hours together than some married couples spent together in a year.",
  "All of this hardship—the rain, the damp, the cold, the mud, the wounds, the hours spent trying to save men’s lives—had bound them together, made them into more than friends.",
  "Sometimes, over here, the only way to handle the emotional pain was to laugh—or cry.",
  "Frankie rarely cried anymore, but when she did, she was probably in Jamie’s arms.",
  "He was always there for her and she was there for him.",
  "He could make her laugh in the harshest of moments.",
  "",
  "They stood together for hours, she and Jamie, working in tandem.",
  "She knew every nuance of emotion on his face: the way he gritted his teeth in anger when he saw a child burned beyond recognition by napalm or a soldier who worried about his friends even as he was bleeding out.",
  "She knew he missed his beloved Wyoming ranch, with its cool nights and hot days, and its horses in the barn, and a field full of flowers just beyond his front porch.",
  "He missed fly-fishing and horseback riding and floating down the Snake River on an inner tube, a six-pack of beer floating with him.",
  "She knew that Sarah was a kindergarten teacher who sent him baked goods every week and worried that he didn’t write back often enough, and repeatedly asked if he was okay, and that he couldn’t write anything in answer to that question except Yes.",
  "",
  "She fought her feelings for him, but at night, alone in her cot, she thought of him, thought, What if.",
  "It might all be a mirage, this connection between them, brought on by proximity and the horror of what they saw every day, but it felt real.",
  "",
  "He touched her whenever he could, as casually as possible, and with a forced smile.",
  "Sometimes they found themselves standing together, or sitting side by side, just staring at each other, saying nothing, both of them feeling too much for the other and knowing that words wouldn’t ease their longing.",

  "She peeled her gloves off and lowered her mask.",
  "Both of them had red mud in the corners of their eyes, dripping down in tears, and in their teeth.",

  "Dinner last night?",
  "Her stomach grumbled.",
  "She didn’t signal her intention, just stumbled sideways, bumping into Jamie, pushing him aside without meaning to.",

  "The love she felt for him caused a physical ache in her chest.",

  "She wanted to say something clever, but nothing came to her.",
  "Flipping up her hood, she angled forward to keep the rain from sluicing down her back and ran for the nurses’ showers.",

  "She washed her hair and body.",
  "Without even bothering to dry off, she stepped back into her damp, dirty clothes and boots, flung the slick wet poncho back over her body, and ducked back into the rain.",
  "At the plank bridge that ran over a gushing river of mud and water, she paused, slowed enough to check her balance so she didn’t fall into the coiled concertina wire on either side, and then she was back under the covered walkway.",

  "The hooch was rattled by the rain; water sluiced down the wooden sides, created an ankle-deep puddle of red mud outside the door.",

  "So, where’s the booze?”",

  "Coyote ducked over to a pyramid of coolers and opened the top one, pulling out four cold beers and bringing them back.",

  "A tall man with a shaggy mustache and a Rainier Beer T-shirt stood at the wheel.",

  "There were more than 450,000 American men in Vietnam now and God knew how many deaths and casualties.",
  "You certainly couldn’t find that answer in the Stars and Stripes.",
  "Many of the new troops in-country had barely six weeks of training.",
  "Unlike in World War II, when soldiers had trained together in platoons and went to war alongside men with whom they’d trained, these new recruits came alone and were dropped in wherever they were needed, without the support of a platoon, without men they knew they could depend on.",
  "Army Basic Training had been shortened to get the men in combat sooner; Frankie wondered who in the hell decided that less training for war was a good idea, but no one had asked her opinion.",
  "",
  "There were good days, though, when few wounded came in and the sound of helicopters was far away; days when the nurses played games and read novels and wrote letters home and organized MEDCAP trips to local villages to offer medical services.",
  "On bad days, Frankie heard the distinctive roar of the twin-engine Chinook helicopter, the workhorse behemoth that could hold more than two dozen injured, and knew trouble was on its way.",
  "Sometimes the pushes were so intense, the numbers of incoming and their injuries so bad, that Frankie and Barb and Hap and the rest of the doctors and nurses worked for eighteen hours straight on both soldiers and civilians, with barely a break for food or drink.",
  "",
  "Frankie had learned to think fast and move faster.",
  "She could do more than she’d ever imagined; she could initiate a surgery or close a wound or put in a chest tube.",
  "Hap trusted her with morphine administration and talked her through all of his surgeries, teaching her every step of the way.",
  "And some of this took place under direct rocket attack and mandatory blackout conditions, in a pouring rain.",

  "It wasn’t her job, but she did it anyway.",
  "She was both dead on her feet and full of buzzing adrenaline.",
  "",
  "She shoved the mop forward, through the blood, pushing it away.",
  "It slimed right back where it had been.",

  "Hap entered the OR, nodded at the corpsman at the desk doing paperwork.",
  "He approached Frankie slowly, touched her shoulder.",
  "“You don’t need to mop, McGrath.”",

  "He was giving her that look—she knew it now—sadness wrapped in compassion, wrapped in understanding.",
  "It was how they all looked at each other after a MASCAL, when all you could really count were the men you’d lost.",
  "",
  "In the past ten days, most of them rainy, Frankie had spent well over a hundred hours across an operating table from this man.",
  "She knew that he never sweated, no matter how hot it was or how tough the surgery was; she knew that in easy moments, he hummed “Ain’t That a Shame” under his breath, and in harder times, he made a clacking, angry sound in his jaw.",
  "She knew he wore a wedding ring, and that he loved his wife and worried about his oldest son.",
  "She also knew that he made the sign of the cross every time he finished a surgery, and that, like her, he wore a Saint Christopher medal next to his dog tags.",

  "Pelatihan Dasar Angkatan Darat telah dipersingkat agar para pria itu bisa terjun ke pertempuran lebih cepat; Frankie bertanya-tanya siapa orang gila yang memutuskan bahwa mengurangi pelatihan perang adalah ide bagus, tetapi tak ada yang menanyakan pendapatnya.",

  "Namun, ada hari-hari baik, ketika hanya sedikit korban luka yang masuk dan suara helikopter terdengar jauh; hari-hari ketika para perawat bermain gim, membaca novel, menulis surat ke rumah, dan mengatur perjalanan MEDCAP ke desa-desa setempat untuk menawarkan layanan medis.",
  "Pada hari-hari buruk, Frankie mendengar deru khas helikopter Chinook bermesin ganda, raksasa pekerja keras yang bisa memuat lebih dari dua lusin korban luka, dan tahu bahwa masalah sedang menuju ke arahnya.",
  "Terkadang serbuan pasien begitu intens, jumlah yang masuk dan luka-luka mereka begitu parah, sehingga Frankie dan Barb serta Hap dan dokter serta perawat lainnya bekerja selama delapan belas jam berturut-turut menangani tentara maupun warga sipil, nyaris tanpa istirahat untuk makan atau minum.",

  "After more than twenty-two hours of travel, Frankie stumbled into the lobby of the Coco Palms Hotel on the island of Kauai, and checked in.",
  "Once in her room, without bothering to shower, she yanked the curtains closed and collapsed onto the softest bed she’d ever felt and fell asleep.",
  "",
  "When she woke, she heard birds singing.",
  "",
  "Birds.",
  "Singing.",
  "",
  "No mortars exploding or shells hammering the walls, no smell of blood or shit or smoke in the air, no screaming, no Dust Offs whirring overhead.",
  "",
  "The captain had been right; Frankie needed this respite.",
  "",
  "She lay in bed, feeling drowsy in a lovely way and listening to the unexpected birdsong, surprised to see that it was well past noon.",
  "Refreshed and revived, she got out of bed and pushed the heavy gardenia-print yellow-and-white drapes aside and saw Kauai for the first time.",
  "",
  "“Wow.”",
  "",
  "The California beaches were magnificent, powerful, endless, and awe-inspiring, but this … this was an intimate kind of beauty, drenched in jewel tones—golden sand, vivid green grass, deep blue skies, vibrant purple bougainvilleas.",
  "",
  "She opened the window and leaned out into the bright, beautiful day.",
  "The air smelled of a sweet floral fragrance mingled with the sharp tang of the sea.",
  "Palm trees grew on a flat patch of lawn, singly and in groups.",
  "",
  "She took a long, hot, luxurious bath, using soap that smelled of coconut, and washed and dried her hair, seeing for the first time how long it had grown.",
  "She’d spent months pruning it as she would a runaway weed, cutting away whatever impaired her view, which left her with an uneven fringe of bangs.",
  "Thankfully, she had her boonie hat.",
  "It wasn’t fashionable, in fact was the opposite, but the olive-drab hat had become a favorite possession in ’Nam, almost a companion, and it kept the sun out of her eyes.",
  "A dozen pins and patches decorated the crown, gifts she’d gotten from her patients.",
  "Each bore the insignia of some unit.",
  "The Screaming Eagles, the Seawolves, the Big Red One.",
  "",
  "She put on her faded two-piece knit bathing suit and SKI VIETNAM T-shirt and shorts, noticing that everything bore the pink-red tint of the Vietnam soil.",
  "For the first time in months, she bothered with makeup—mascara and lipstick and blush.",
  "Slipping into sandals, she put on sunglasses, grabbed a hotel towel, and went down to the lobby.",
  "",
  "Although she was hungry—her stomach was grumbling loudly—she needed fresh air more.",
  "Fresh air and the sound of the sea.",
  "A little sand between her toes, a little floating in salt water.",
  "",
  "She left the hotel and walked through the manicured grounds, palm trees swaying all around her.",
  "She crossed the quiet street and stepped out onto the sand.",
  "Tomorrow she would bring her camera and take pictures of the beauty around her.",
  "",
  "On this sunny day, locals and tourists filled the beach: families on blankets; parents keeping watchful eyes on their children, some of whom were naked, all of whom were smiling brightly.",
  "There were men with long hair, wearing peace symbol necklaces, and several men in khaki shorts, their hair buzzed to regulation length, standing at a lava-rock beach bar with a thatched roof.",
  "SEASHELL SNACK BAR AND COCKTAILS read the sign.",
  "",
  "Out in the ocean, she saw kids on surfboards, bobbing on the incoming swells.",
  "It made her think of Finley, made her miss him acutely.",
  "That’s your wave, doll.",
  "Paddle harder.",
  "She let out a long breath; it had become a kind of goodbye, her way of releasing her grief just enough to keep going.",
  "",
  "She stripped down to her bathing suit and walked into the sea.",
  "The water was warmer than she was used to in California, but still cool.",
  "Sunshine sparkled on the surface.",
  "She swam beyond the low, incoming curl of surf and flipped onto her back in the calm swells.",
  "",
  "Eyes closed, she felt almost young again, a girl floating on waves with the sun streaming down on her.",
  "",
  "Finally, she left the water and staked out a patch of sand—all by herself, no one around—and laid out her towel.",
  "",
  "Eyes shielded by her boonie hat and big round sunglasses, she drifted to sleep, slept deeply, and woke with the sun lowered in the sky.",
  "She sat up, brought her knees up, and stared out to sea.",
  "Treasured images came to her, of Finley paddling out on his surfboard, waving his hand, telling her to catch up.",
  "Of them on the beach, bouncing uncomfortably on the backs of their rental horses, Finley muttering something about the family jewels.",
  "And the sunsets they’d watched together as they spun out their childish dreams and talked about their future.",
  "",
  "“Can I buy you a drink, ma’am?”",

  "Frankie shook herself free of the memories and looked up.",
  "A young man stood in front of her, shirtless, wearing khaki shorts and a military belt.",
  "A SEMPER FI tattoo covered the top left quadrant of his chest.",
  "She could tell by his eyes that he’d been in-country, maybe in the bush.",
  "She wondered how long the men would wear that haunted, hunted look.",
  "She hated to let him down.",
  "“Sorry, Marine.",
  "I came here for the quiet.",
  "Stay safe.”",
  "",
  "He turned away, no doubt scouting the beach for another girl to approach.",
  "",
  "Frankie began to feel the sting of a sunburn and noticed how pink her legs were.",
  "How long had she been out here?",
  "",
  "She heard someone else coming her way.",
  "She should have gone farther down the beach, away from the snack bar.",
  "This time she didn’t look up.",
  "“I’m fine alone, thanks.”",
  "",
  "“Are you?”",
  "",
  "She slowly looked up, lowered her big round sunglasses.",
  "",
  "Rye.",
  "",
  "He stood at ease, his hands clasped behind him.",
  "He wore multicolored shorts and a pale blue T-shirt that read LIVE TO SURF, but no one would mistake him for a surfer, not with his military posture and built-up muscles and unfashionably short hair.",
  "",
  "“This is quite a coincidence,” Frankie said.",

  "“There’s something between us, Frankie.",
  "Tell me you don’t feel it and I’ll walk away.”",
  "",
  "Frankie stood up to face him.",
  "",
  "“Say you don’t want me.”",
  "The way he said it revealed an unexpected vulnerability.",
  "",
  "There was no way in the world she could flirt with him or lie.",
  "“I can’t say that,” she said evenly.",
  "",
  "He finally released a breath.",
  "“Will you have dinner with me tonight?”",
  "",
  "She knew it wasn’t just dinner he wanted; she wanted more, too.",
  "Still, he was Rye Walsh, the rule-breaker who’d pushed her brother into trouble more than once (not that Finley needed much help in that regard), and she knew she wouldn’t be safe with a man like him.",
  "But he was still an officer, and hopefully a gentleman.",
  "“You broke off your engagement?",
  "You swear it?”",
  "",
  "“I swear I’m not engaged.”",

  "“Okay, shave your legs and armpits.",

  "Frankie left the lobby and hailed a cab, which took her into the small town of Lihue.",
  "There, she got her hair cut in a chin-length, side-parted bob, and bought a red-and-white hibiscus-print sheath dress with a matching headscarf and heeled white sandals.",
  "",
  "Back at the hotel, she followed Barb’s advice and shaved carefully and moisturized her sunburned skin.",
  "",
  "As she stood in her hotel room bathroom and stared into the opalescent shell-framed mirror that hung over a large clamshell sink, she hardly recognized herself.",
  "The beautician had brought back the shine in her black hair and the sleek haircut emphasized her blue eyes and the sharp line of her cheekbones.",
  "There was still an air of sadness about her—the sorrow she’d learned in Vietnam.",
  "She wondered if that would ever fade.",
  "But there was a youthful excitement in her look, too.",
  "Hope.",
  "Long since forgotten and never again to be taken for granted.",
  "",
  "At 1830 hours, she left her room and went downstairs.",
  "The ceiling of the hotel lobby arched high overhead, soared up like the nave of a church.",
  "",
  "She entered the open-air dining room.",
  "Beyond the half walls, she saw the shadowy lagoons where tiki torches blazed.",
  "Coconut palm fronds swayed and whispered, stark black trees against a violet sky.",
  "Somewhere, someone was playing a ukulele.",
  "",
  "Most of the tables were full of vacationers, talking, laughing, smoking.",
  "It was a sharp reminder that while she’d been in Vietnam, the world had gone on.",
  "Kids had gone to school, parents had gone to work; not everyone lived and breathed the war.",
  "In ’Nam, it was easy to hear about the protests going on in America and think that everyone was burning the flag and protesting for peace; here, it was obvious that most people had quietly gone on with their lives, avoiding the dangerous shores on either side of the divide.",
  "",
  "She saw Rye seated at a quiet table in the back corner.",
  "",
  "A lovely Hawaiian woman, dressed in a floor-length bark-cloth print muumuu, wearing a fragrant lei, led her across the busy restaurant.",
  "",
  "As she neared the table, Rye stood, waited for her to be seated before he sat back down.",
  "",
  "He offered her a gorgeous lei made of small yellow-white flowers.",
  "“It’s white ginger.”",

  "The fragrance was intoxicating.",
  "",
  "“May I bring you a cocktail?”",
  "the hostess asked when Frankie was seated.",

  "Frankie nodded.",
  "“Yes.",
  "Thank you.”",

  "“I’ll have a Jameson on the rocks,” Rye said.",

  "The hostess left them alone.",

  "The candle in the center of the table sent golden light upward.",
  "",
  "The hostess returned with the two drinks and a pair of menus.",
  "",
  "The mai tai was sweet and sour and strong.",
  "Frankie toyed with the pink umbrella, lifted it, ate the sweet, sweet maraschino cherry and chunk of pineapple.",
  "She knew this dinner with him meant something, maybe everything, but she felt awkward.",
  "She could reach into a man’s chest and hold his heart in her hands, but she had forgotten how to make small talk.",
  "",
  "Rye stared down into his glass, rattled his ice cubes around.",
  "",
  "“Ice,” Frankie said, just to be talking.",
  "“I’ll never take that for granted again.”",

  "“Or a hot bath.”",
  "",
  "“Or dry sheets.”",

  "The waitress appeared, took their orders, and disappeared again.",
  "",
  "Frankie could tell that he was uncertain, too.",
  "They knew each other only in the flimsiest of ways, and now he’d broken off an engagement for a chance that might come to nothing.",

  "The waitress delivered two shrimp cocktails.",

  "Frankie dipped a plump, pink shrimp in the spicy cocktail sauce and took a bite, chewing slowly.",

  "“A going-away party for Vietnam,” he said.",
  "“Talk about another world.”",

  "“The kind who didn’t mind steaming up the windows of a parked car,” Frankie said, smiling.",
  "“That sounds like Fin.”",
  "",
  "“I knew he was right.",
  "I had nothing in common with a woman like you.",
  "Still, I followed you into the office that night, thought I’d steal a kiss, but I could tell you weren’t ready.",
  "And now…”",

  "“Here we are,” Frankie said in understanding.",
  "They had made it through hardship—death all around—to be here, sipping cocktails on a tropical island.",
  "Did it mean something?",

  "How would they know unless they dared to begin?",

  "They needed first to get to know each other.",

  "Twenty questions.",
  "Good choice.",
  "No siblings.",

  "The waitress appeared at their table, paused, then said, “I’m sorry to disturb you, sir, but there’s a gentleman at the bar.",

  "Behind her, at the dark lava-rock bar area, an elderly man in an out-of-style suit and tie stood and waved.",

  "“Of course,” Rye answered.",

  "The man who approached them walked in a slow, limping gait.",

  "Bless you.”",

  "Moments after the man left, the waitress brought their entrées—lamb roasted in a firepit, baby peas, and buttery potatoes rissole.",
  "Throughout the meal, they talked about their hopes for life after Vietnam, the friends they’d made over there, the protests going on back home.",
  "",
  "When dinner was over—after a fabulous Baked Alaska—Rye picked up a picnic basket at his feet and offered Frankie his arm.",

  "Outside, the hotel grounds were a wonderland of shadow and moonlight and tiki torches.",

  "Rye led her to the beach, where he found a private, perfect spot, far from the closed-up snack shack, and unpacked the basket he’d brought.",

  "Dia bisa mendengar deburan ombak dari sini; suara akrab yang menenangkan kecemasannya.",
  "Sekelompok anak-anak bersepeda, dengan kartu remi di jari-jari roda, melesat melewatinya sambil tertawa.",
  "Dia tak bisa menahan diri untuk tidak memikirkan Finley, tentang benteng-benteng yang pernah mereka bangun di antara pohon eukaliptus, tentang istana pasir yang mereka buat, tentang jam-jam yang dihabiskan di atas sepeda.",
  "Menjelang malam, lampu-lampu teras akan mulai menyala di sepanjang jalan—suar yang digunakan para ibu untuk menuntun anak-anak mereka pulang untuk makan malam.",

  "Sepasang jet Angkatan Laut menderu di atas kepala.",

  "Apa yang salah?",

  "Dia meninggalkan ibunya di ruang tamu dan menuju kamar tidur masa kecilnya, dengan tempat tidur berkelambu dan renda-renda merah muda.",
  "Kebanyakan anak punya poster di kamar mereka, tapi Ibu tidak mengizinkan paku ditancapkan ke wallpaper mahalnya, jadi Frankie memajang seni bingkai di dindingnya.",
  "Deretan boneka binatang tua duduk di sepanjang bagian atas rak bukunya.",

  "",
  "Dia tidak seharusnya minum sebelum giliran jaga di rumah sakit.",
  "",
  "Ini hanya pesta.",
  "Tidak ada yang berbahaya atau menakutkan, tetapi dia merasakan kecemasan menjalar di tubuhnya.",

  "At twenty-five, Frankie moved with the kind of caution that came with age; she was constantly on guard, aware that something bad could happen at any moment.",
  "She trusted neither the ground beneath her feet nor the sky above her head.",
  "Since coming home from war, she had learned how fragile she was, how easily upended her emotions could be.",
  "",
  "Still, she had learned to hide her outbursts, her crying jags, even from her two best friends, who, for most of their first year in Virginia, had watched her intently, trying constantly to divine her moods, assess her level of self-destruction, her grief and anger.",
  "In the beginning, it had been difficult, settling into the time-honored McGrath camouflage of I’m okay.",
  "",
  "The nightmares had been terrible when she first arrived here, had still wrenched her out of sleep and sent her careening onto the floor.",

  "But time—and friendship—had done exactly as promised: pain and grief had grown soft in her hands, almost pliable.",
  "She found she could form them into something kinder if she was deliberate in thought and action, if she lived a careful, cautious life, if she stayed away from anything that reminded her of the war, of loss, of death.",

  "In their family’s way, neither spoke of the terrible night that had precipitated Frankie’s flight across the country.",

  "Di usia dua puluh lima, Frankie bergerak dengan kehati-hatian layaknya orang tua; ia terus waspada, sadar bahwa hal buruk bisa terjadi kapan saja.",
  "Ia tak memercayai tanah yang dipijaknya maupun langit di atas kepalanya.",
  "Sejak pulang dari perang, ia menyadari betapa rapuh dirinya, betapa mudah emosinya terbolak-balik.",
  "",
  "Namun, ia telah belajar menyembunyikan ledakan emosinya, tangisannya, bahkan dari dua sahabat baiknya, yang selama setahun pertama di Virginia terus mengamatinya lekat-lekat, berusaha menebak suasana hatinya, menakar tingkat penghancuran dirinya, kesedihannya, dan amarahnya.",
  "Awalnya sulit untuk membiasakan diri dengan kamuflase turun-temurun keluarga McGrath: aku baik-baik saja.",
  "",
  "Mimpi-mimpi buruk itu sangat mengerikan saat ia baru tiba di sini, masih sering menyentaknya bangun dan membuatnya terpelanting ke lantai.",
  "",
  "Namun waktu—dan persahabatan—telah menepati janjinya: rasa sakit dan duka itu melunak di tangannya, hampir bisa dibentuk.",
  "Ia mendapati bahwa ia bisa membentuknya menjadi sesuatu yang lebih ramah jika ia berpikir dan bertindak dengan sengaja, jika ia menjalani hidup yang cermat dan hati-hati, jika ia menjauhi segala sesuatu yang mengingatkannya pada perang, pada kehilangan, pada kematian.",
  "",
  "Menjelang Natal tahun pertama itu, ia merasa cukup kuat untuk menyurati ibunya, yang segera membalasnya.",
  "Sesuai cara keluarga mereka, tak satu pun membicarakan malam mengerikan yang memicu pelarian Frankie ke sisi lain negeri ini.",
  "Mereka sekadar kembali ke jalan yang familier, dengan landasan yang sedikit bergelombang di antara mereka, namun sama-sama bertekad untuk tetap bertahan.",
  "Frankie ingat, dan sering membaca ulang, surat pertama dari ibunya itu: Ibu sangat berterima kasih kepada teman-teman tentaramu karena telah mendampingimu saat Ayah dan Ibu tidak bisa.",
  "Kami mencintaimu, dan jika kami tidak cukup sering mengatakannya, itu karena kami dibesarkan dalam keluarga yang tidak memiliki kosakata seperti itu.",
  "Mengenai ayahmu dan … kebungkamannya tentangmu dan perang itu.",
  "Yang bisa Ibu katakan hanyalah ada sesuatu dalam dirinya yang hancur karena tidak bisa mengabdi pada negaranya.",
  "Semua pria dari generasinya pergi ke Eropa, sementara dia tetap di rumah.",
  "Ya, dia bangga pada Finley dan malu padamu.",
  "Namun mungkin sebenarnya dia malu pada dirinya sendiri dan khawatir kau menilainya dengan keras, seperti ketakutannya akan penilaian teman-temannya …",
  "",
  "Frankie tak pernah membicarakan pergulatan batinnya, berusaha tak pernah mengucapkan kata Vietnam keras-keras.",
  "Dan ketika ia merasakan tekanan darahnya naik, banjir kesedihan atau amarah, ia tersenyum kaku dan meninggalkan ruangan mana pun ia berada.",
  "Ia belajar bahwa orang akan memperhatikan suara yang meninggi; keheningan adalah kamuflase sempurna untuk rasa sakit.",
  "",
  "Awalnya, hampir mustahil memisahkan Vietnam dari kisah hidupnya.",
  "Dunia, tampaknya, telah bersekongkol menentang penyembuhan semacam itu.",
  "",
  "Perang itu terus-menerus ada dalam percakapan.",
  "Di bar, di ruang tamu, di televisi.",
  "Semua orang punya pendapat.",
  "Kini mayoritas orang Amerika tampaknya menentang perang itu dan para pria yang bertempur di sana.",
  "Pada tahun 1969, dunia mengetahui pembantaian mengerikan di My Lai, di mana tentara Amerika telah membunuh hingga lima ratus warga sipil Vietnam Selatan yang tak bersenjata—pria, wanita, dan anak-anak—di desa mereka sendiri.",
  "Hal itu mengintensifkan sebutan pembunuh bayi bagi para veteran, yang semakin banyak beralih ke heroin di medan perang dan pulang dalam keadaan kecanduan.",
  "",
  "Amerika kalah perang; itu jelas bagi semua orang kecuali Nixon, yang terus membohongi rakyat dan mengirim tentara ke medan perang, terlalu banyak dari mereka yang pulang dalam kantong jenazah.",
  "",
  "Setiap wanita itu merespons secara berbeda terhadap gelombang kekerasan yang mencabik-cabik negara, memisahkan yang muda dari yang tua, kaya dari miskin, konservatif dari liberal.",
  "Ethel sedang menjalani tahun ketiga sekolah kedokteran hewan dan bekerja paruh waktu bersama ayahnya.",
  "Dia dan Noah mulai membicarakan pernikahan, anak-anak.",
  "Keduanya tak pernah melewatkan ibadah Minggu di gereja atau pertandingan football SMA setempat.",
  "Kegemaran mereka pada kaserol dan permainan kartu cribbage telah menjadi lelucon lama di antara para wanita itu.",
  "Ethel tumbuh besar di peternakan ini, di antara orang-orang ini, dan dia berniat dikuburkan di sini.",
  "Jadi dia tetap menunduk, mengerjakan pekerjaannya, dan tidak mengatakan hal kontroversial apa pun kepada teman dan tetangganya.",
  "Perang ini akan segera berakhir, katanya selalu, tapi aku akan selalu tinggal di sini.",
  "Anak-anakku akan ikut klub 4-H, aku mungkin akan memimpin komite sekolah sialan itu.",
  "",
  "Barb adalah kebalikannya dalam segala hal.",
  "Dia menjadi anggota aktif yang vokal dalam Vietnam Veterans Against the War.",
  "Dia pergi ke pertemuan.",
  "Dia melukis papan tanda.",
  "Dia berdemo.",
  "Dan bukan hanya soal perang.",
  "Dia melobi pengesahan Amandemen Hak Setara.",
  "Dia berpawai demi hak wanita atas aborsi yang aman dan layanan kesehatan dasar.",
  "Saat tidak sedang berusaha mengubah dunia, dia mencari uang dengan menjadi bartender.",
  "Itu, katanya, pekerjaan hebat bagi wanita yang belum memutuskan di mana tempatnya.",

  "Frankie, di sisi lain, menemukan jalan kembalinya melalui keperawatan.",
  "Ia menahan prasangka awal dan pengabaian terhadap pelatihan Vietnam-nya dan bertekad menunjukkan kemampuannya.",
  "Ia bekerja lebih keras dan lebih lama dari sebagian besar perawat lain, menghabiskan banyak jam kerja, dan mengambil kelas khusus.",
  "Seiring waktu, ia menjadi perawat bedah; kini ia sedang mengejar spesialisasi bedah trauma.",
  "",
  "Pada pagi bulan April yang sejuk ini, ia bangun jauh sebelum fajar dan berpakaian untuk berkuda.",
  "Di luar pasti dingin, dengan kesegaran musim semi di udara.",
  "",
  "Ia mulai mencintai udara Selatan yang beraroma manis, cara kabut memeluk rerumputan di pagi hari.",
  "Itu menenangkan gejolak dalam jiwanya.",
  "Hari ini, pohon-pohon ceri di sepanjang jalan masuk sedang mekar penuh dengan warna merah muda.",
  "Ethel benar, bertahun-tahun yang lalu, saat dia bilang bahwa menunggang kuda bisa memulihkan rasa damai seseorang.",
  "",
  "Frankie menyukai padang hijau yang bergelombang, pagar kayu hitam empat palang, pepohonan yang berubah warna seiring cuaca.",
  "Kini dedaunan berwarna hijau limau cerah tanda pertumbuhan baru, dan penuh dengan bunga merah muda.",
  "Namun, berada di dekat kuda-kudalah yang paling menenangkan Frankie.",
  "Ethel benar soal itu.",
  "Berkuda telah menenangkan Frankie sama seperti persahabatan.",
  "",
  "Frankie menunduk melewati celah kosong di antara palang pagar dan menuju ke kandang; ia hampir tak bisa melihat sepatu botnya, kabut begitu tebal dan kelabu.",
  "",
  "Di dalam, kandang berbau kotoran ternak, jerami segar, dan biji-bijian yang mereka simpan dalam tong sampah logam besar.",
  "Kuda-kuda meringkik pelan padanya saat ia lewat.",
  "",
  "Di kandang terakhir sebelah kiri, ia berhenti dan mengangkat palang pintu.",
  "Silver Birch berjalan ke arahnya, bibirnya bergerak-gerak mencari camilan, napasnya mendengus.",
  "",
  "“Hei, cantik,” sapa Frankie, mengulurkan tangannya yang bersarung.",
  "",
  "Silver memakan biji-bijian itu dengan berantakan, lebih banyak yang jatuh ke tanah daripada yang masuk ke mulutnya.",
  "Frankie menuntun kuda betina itu ke lorong dan memasang pelana dengan cepat, menekan lutut ke perut kuda itu untuk membantunya mengencangkan tali perut.",
  "",
  "Dalam sekejap, Frankie dan Silver sudah berada di jalan setapak, berderap menembus kabut.",
  "Saat Silver mulai terdengar terengah-engah, Frankie memperlambat kuda itu menjadi lari kecil, lalu berjalan.",
  "Mereka berjalan pulang perlahan, melangkah dengan irama yang stabil dan menenangkan.",
  "",
  "Kembali di kandang, ia memberi makan dan minum kuda-kuda, melepaskan Silver, dan menuju kembali ke barak kecil.",
  "Sinar matahari pagi membanjiri ladang.",
  "Di sebelah kiri ada rumah utama, dengan atap curam, beranda besar yang menyambut, dan dinding kayu bercat putih, tempat Ethel tinggal bersama ayahnya.",
  "Jauh di sebelah kanan ada barak yang dulu menampung para pekerja ladang.",
  "Selama delapan belas bulan terakhir, tempat itu telah direnovasi menjadi pondok dua kamar tidur tempat Frankie dan Barb tinggal.",
  "Ketiga wanita itu telah belajar cara mengecat, membongkar, membangun kembali, dan melakukan pekerjaan pipa dasar.",
  "Mereka menghabiskan berjam-jam berburu di obral garasi dan mengangkut barang rongsokan orang lain untuk dijadikan harta karun mereka.",
  "Banyak malam dihabiskan duduk di sekitar perapian batu sungai yang berjelaga, mengobrol.",
  "Mereka tak pernah kehabisan bahan pembicaraan.",
  "",
  "Frankie menaiki beberapa anak tangga dan masuk ke satu-satunya kamar mandi di barak itu, tempat ia mandi, berganti pakaian, dan bersiap kerja.",

  "She swore each day she’d tell him to go away and not come back until he was divorced, but when he showed up at her door, wearing a smile just for her, she was lost, and as good as it felt to lose herself in his arms, the pleasure turned cold when he left her bed.",
  "Each day she was reminded of her weakness, her dishonesty, her immorality, her obsession.",
  "Over and over and over.",
  "At night, when she was alone, she agonized that he was in bed with his wife and she imagined the pain this affair would cause the innocent Joey.",
  "But as much as she despised herself, she couldn’t deny him.",
  "She was like a starving person who was given two hours a day in a bakery, and in those hours, she came fully, gloriously alive, reveled in her appetite.",

  "Barb was smiling so brightly it made Frankie’s whole life look tawdry, sinful.",

  "There, she thought, that’s love.",
  "The way Barb kissed her mom and helped her into her chair in the front row; the way Jere looked at his bride.",

  "Dalam sesi demi sesi, hari demi hari, ia menelanjangi diri dan masa lalunya, membuka luka-lukanya yang terdalam.",
  "Ia bercerita tentang bayi yang meninggal dalam pelukannya karena luka bakar napalm, para pasien yang meninggal di atas kuda-kuda kayu di lumpur berdarah, tentang para pemuda yang baru lepas remaja yang berpegangan pada tangannya, tentang siaga merah, dan operasi di lantai barak Quonset dengan senter saat serangan mortir, tentang Mai, gadis kecil yang kadang masih muncul dalam mimpinya.",

  "It was remarkable how quickly a turbulent world could calm.",
  "In early 1974, with the war over, the country seemed to release a great exhalation of relief.",
  "The fight for rights went on, of course: Civil rights and women’s rights were a constant battle and the Stonewall riots had put gay rights in the news, too.",
  "Equality was the goal, but no longer in that hold-a-sign-and-march kind of way.",
  "",
  "The Vietnam veterans disappeared into the landscape, hiding in plain sight among a populace that either held them in contempt or considered them not at all.",
  "The hippies changed, too; they graduated from college and left their communes and cut their hair and began to look for jobs.",
  "Even the music changed.",
  "Gone was the angry protest music of the war.",
  "Now everyone sang along to John Denver and Linda Ronstadt and Elton John.",
  "The Beatles had broken up.",
  "Janis and Jimi were dead.",
  "",
  "Frankie was fighting for a metamorphosis of her own.",
  "She had come to the inpatient center unwillingly, or maybe not that, exactly.",
  "Unconscious was more like it.",
  "",
  "By February, although she felt stronger, she was well aware that she could relapse in an instant, fall again to her knees.",
  "Sometimes it felt overwhelming, to think of what her life would look like from now on.",
  "So much of what had filled her up in the past few years was dark—memories, love, nightmares.",
  "She didn’t know who she was without the pain or the need to hide it.",
  "",
  "But sobriety—and therapy—had given her the tools to heal.",
  "One day at a time.",
  "For the first time in years, she was sometimes able to imagine a future that didn’t include pain or pretense.",
  "She didn’t believe in “soldiering on” anymore and knew that trying to forget trauma only gave grim memories a fecund soil in which to grow.",
  "She accepted the loss of her nursing license and hoped to someday get it back, but she didn’t take that future for granted.",
  "",
  "She still had nightmares, still sometimes woke on the floor of her dorm-like room, especially following an emotional therapy or rap session.",
  "She still longed for people who were gone from her life and whom she’d lost, but as Henry and Dr. Alden each reminded her often, regrets were a waste of time.",
  "If only was the bend in a troubling road.",
  "She learned day by day how to navigate through life, keep going, keep moving forward.",
  "",
  "Surprisingly, of all her pains and regrets, those that had driven her to drink too much and get hooked on pills and lose her nursing license, Rye had been the easiest to exorcise.",
  "",
  "She’d begun her treatment devastated by her choice to have an affair with a married man and destroyed by her belief in him and his love.",
  "She’d learned that she was weak, a sinner, but at the bottom of it all, deep down, she’d believed that Rye loved her.",
  "Love had somehow given her latitude to recast her terrible choice in a prettier light.",
  "",
  "Until the day Dr. Alden had asked, “When did Rye first tell you he loved you?”",
  "",
  "The question brought Frankie upright on the sofa.",
  "Had Rye ever told her he loved her?",
  "",
  "She scrolled through her memories; what she found was this: I’m afraid I’ll love you till I die.",
  "",
  "At the time, she’d seen it as romantic, sweeping, epic.",
  "Now she saw the sentiment for what it was.",
  "The dark side of love.",
  "What he’d really been saying was, I don’t want to love you.",
  "",
  "It had never been real love for him.",
  "Oh, he’d shown up in Kauai to romance her, thinking that she was leaving the military within weeks and their affair would be a bit of fun before she left.",
  "She’d believed every moment with him.",
  "",
  "Worst of all, his lies had exposed an immorality in her that she could have sworn hadn’t existed before him.",
  "She’d begun by believing she was stupid and learned slowly that she was just human.",
  "",
  "From now on, she would always know there was a fragility in her and no matter how strong she became, she would have to guard against it.",
  "“I worry I don’t believe in love anymore,” she told Dr. Alden once.",
  "",
  "“But lots of people love you, Frankie, don’t they?”",
  "Dr. Alden had said.",
  "",
  "She closed her eyes, thought of the best moments of her life—with her dad calling her Peanut and lifting her into the air, her mother holding her tightly while she cried, and Finley teaching her to surf, sharing his secrets, holding her hand.",
  "Jamie, teaching her to believe in herself, to try.",
  "No fear, McGrath.",
  "And Barb and Ethel, always there for her.",
  "",
  "“Yeah,” she said quietly, and let those memories be her shield, her strength, her hope.",
  "",
  "In the end, the hardest aspect of her recovery wasn’t Rye.",
  "Neither was it the pills or the drugs.",
  "",
  "The thing she still grappled most violently with was Vietnam.",
  "Those were the nightmares that haunted her.",
  "She talked about it with her doctor, told him her stories, and hoped for a kind of resolution, and while talking helped, she knew that Dr. Alden didn’t understand.",
  "Not really.",
  "She saw the way he sometimes grimaced at a memory, heard words like napalm and flinched.",
  "Those moments reminded her that he had never been in war, and no one who hadn’t been in the shit could really understand it.",
  "",
  "She knew, too, that when she left the safety of the inpatient center, she would be thrust back into a world where Vietnam veterans were supposed to be invisible, the women most of all.",
  "",
  "Now, though, regardless of how she felt or how the world felt about her or whether she felt ready, it was time for her to leave the center.",
  "She had been here too long already, extended her original stay, and Henry had very gently told her that she was taking the spot from someone else who needed to be saved.",
  "",
  "“You’re ready,” Henry said from across the desk.",
  "",
  "Frankie stood up.",
  "She didn’t feel ready.",
  "By any method or measure, she had failed in the world after Vietnam.",
  "“So you and Dr. Alden keep saying.”",
  "She walked over to his bookcase, picked up a picture of his nephew, Arturo, in uniform.",

  "So like Finley.",

  "“He learned discipline, that’s for sure,” Henry said.",
  "“My sister says she could never get him to make his bed or fold his clothes before Annapolis, now he likes everything just so.”",
  "",
  "“There’s nothing wrong with a little discipline,” Frankie said.",
  "She picked up a framed photograph of Henry and his fiancée, Natalie, who were soon to be married in some woodland retreat.",
  "They were a perfect match; they spent their weekends hiking and camping and never missed a political event.",
  "She hosted fundraisers for the clinic.",
  "“You’ll invite me to your hippie-dippie wedding, right?”",
  "",
  "“Of course.",
  "You’re leaving the center, Frankie.",
  "Not leaving me.",
  "We are friends.",
  "You can always call me.”",

  "She turned to look at him.",

  "“For all of it.",
  "And I’m—”",

  "“Love means never having to say you’re sorry.”",
  "",
  "Frankie laughed.",
  "“What a crock of shit.",
  "Then again, I’m hardly an expert on love.”",
  "",
  "“You know love, Frankie.”",
  "",
  "He moved toward her, pulled her into an embrace.",
  "",
  "She held on more tightly than she should have, but in the last months, he’d become her lifeline, her anchor, her confidant.",
  "Not her doctor, but her friend, as important in a way as Barb and Ethel.",
  "",
  "“I’ll miss you,” she said.",
  "",
  "He touched her face.",
  "“Just don’t come back here the way you did, okay?",
  "Ask for help when you need it.",
  "Count on the people who love you and, mostly, count on yourself.",
  "One day at a time.",
  "Get a sponsor.",
  "Find your passion.",
  "You’ve got this.”",
  "He paused, didn’t look away.",
  "“You deserve to be loved, Frankie.",
  "In that forever kind of way.",
  "Don’t forget that.”",
  "",
  "Frankie stared at him for another long moment.",
  "She could tell him all of it again, how she’d learned to understand her own weakness, and her own strength, how she’d come to believe that Rye was not just a liar, but selfish and cruel as well.",
  "But none of that mattered anymore; Rye didn’t matter.",
  "If she saw him on the street, she’d pass him by with nothing but a pang of sad remembrance, and Henry knew all of that.",
  "“It was a lucky day when I met you, Henry Acevedo.”",
  "",
  "“Lucky for me, too, Frankie.”",
  "",
  "She bent down and picked up the old, banged-up travel bag her mother had packed for her months ago, when Frankie’s world had collapsed.",
  "",
  "Down the hall, she saw that Jill Landis was conducting a group session: eight new people sat in a horseshoe in front of the therapist.",
  "",
  "A young man with long hair and slumped shoulders was saying something about heroin.",

  "Frankie paused, caught Jill’s gaze, and waved.",
  "Goodbye.",
  "",
  "Here, just like in ’Nam, people came, did their time, were changed in existential ways, and moved on.",
  "Some made it in the outside world, some didn’t.",
  "It was especially bad with Vietnam vets.",
  "The statistics on their rates of suicide were becoming alarming.",
  "",
  "Frankie didn’t go back to her room, vaguely afraid that, once there, she would find a reason not to leave.",
  "She walked through the front doors, out into the cold day.",

  "She saw her mother’s black Cadillac, parked beneath a jacaranda tree.",

  "The driver side door opened.",
  "Then the passenger side.",
  "Dad and Mom stepped out, stood at their respective sides of the car, looking at her.",
  "",
  "Even from here, she saw their joy.",
  "And their anxiety.",
  "",
  "She had given them so much to worry about in a few short years.",
  "Vietnam.",
  "Trauma.",
  "The miscarriage.",
  "Rye.",
  "The drunk driving.",
  "The pills.",
  "She knew how hard all of it was on two people for whom reputation and standing in the community were vital.",
  "She had no idea what they had told their friends this time.",
  "Maybe drug and alcohol treatment had become tagging penguins in Antarctica.",
  "",
  "Either way, she wouldn’t ask.",
  "Having discovered her own failings, she was less inclined to judge others.",
  "",
  "Her parents didn’t understand her, perhaps, and certainly they didn’t condone most of her choices, but they were here.",
  "",
  "You know love, Frankie.",
  "",
  "Frankie walked across the gravel parking lot.",
  "",
  "“Frances,” Mom said at her approach.",

  "A look passed between them, a sharing of emotion between mother and daughter.",
  "“You look good,” Mom said.",
  "“Too thin.”",
  "",
  "“You, too,” Frankie said, walking into her mother’s arms, being held in the new, fierce way that Mom had developed.",
  "Like Frankie, Mom had learned how capricious life and one’s own body could be.",
  "",
  "When Mom finally let go—with tears in her eyes—Frankie turned, looked across the shiny black roof of the Cadillac at her dad.",
  "",
  "She had aged him, she knew, taught him that success and money couldn’t insulate a family from loss or hardship.",
  "Walls around a house were no guarantee of safety, not in a world that was constantly shifting.",
  "He’d changed with the times, in a way, grown out his sideburns, and traded in his custom suits for knit bowling-style shirts and double-knit pants, but there was no denying the wariness in his eyes when he looked at his daughter.",
  "",
  "She remembered him carrying her out of the water that night.",
  "The memory of his crying would always be with her.",
  "What he’d learned about her that night, about them, could never be erased.",
  "She knew a part of him would worry about her forever.",
  "And that he would never say a word about it.",
  "He and her mother were of a quieter generation.",
  "They didn’t believe in words as much as they believed in optimism and hard work.",

  "“I think you look great, Frankie,” he said.",

  "“Thanks, Dad.”",

  "She opened the back door, tossed her bag in the backseat, and slid in next to it.",

  "Suddenly Frankie was ten years old again, sitting in the backseat of the car, sliding across at every turn in the road, bumping into her brother.",

  "“I don’t see how that’s possible.”",

  "“Monsoon season,” Frankie said, staring down at the black, soft-sided bag that had gone around the world with her.",
  "“Everything was wet.",
  "Nothing ever dried.”",

  "“That must have been … unpleasant,” Mom said.",

  "The first real conversation they’d ever had about Vietnam.",

  "Frankie understood his worry.",
  "No one wanted to leave an addict alone for long, but she needed to stand on her own.",

  "She saw the way he frowned.",
  "Nodded.",

  "Anger.",

  "Now a memorial to the men who had died?",
  "",
  "Now?",
  "More than a decade after they’d been unceremoniously buried and forgotten by their fellow Americans?",
  "",
  "As hard as Frankie had worked in the last eight years, and she’d been dedicated to the endeavor, she’d never quite been able to completely dispel the shame her fellow Americans had made her feel over serving in Vietnam, nor her anger at how the government had treated the veterans who returned broken in body or mind or spirit.",
  "Even worse than that, in the late seventies she’d sat here in her living room and watched a fellow Vietnam vet claim on television that Agent Orange had given him—and thousands like him—cancer.",
  "I died in Vietnam; I just didn’t know it, he’d said.",
  "Not long after that, the world had learned that the herbicide also caused miscarriages and birth defects.",
  "Most likely it had caused Frankie’s miscarriage.",

  "Her own government had done that to her.",
  "Maybe if the politicians in Washington, D.C., had built this memorial as an apology to a generation of servicemen and -women and their families, she might have felt differently, but no.",
  "The government hadn’t moved to honor the veterans of Vietnam.",
  "The vets themselves had had to make this happen.",
  "Those who remained honoring those who had fallen.",

  "Pause.",

  "Donna had worked here at the ranch for more than seven years now.",
  "Frankie still remembered the cold day Donna had driven up to the front door, her fake black hair every which way, her skin pale from alcoholism, her voice barely above a whisper.",

  "Cu Chi, ’68.",
  "I got your name from the VA.",
  "I can’t …",

  "",
  "A rap session, Jill at the center had called it.",
  "It helps sometimes to feel you’re not alone.",
  "They’d been there for each other, she and Donna, often held each other upright.",
  "Donna had urged Frankie to fight for the reinstatement of her nursing license, and the fight had proven to be healing.",
  "By the time she’d officially been granted the right to be a nurse again, Frankie felt strong enough to try.",
  "",
  "That had been the beginning of the ranch.",
  "She and Donna had joined forces, using the money from the Coronado cottage sale to make improvements.",

  "In Missoula, both of them took nursing jobs at a local hospital.",
  "After work hours, Frankie attended night classes at the college toward a degree in clinical psychology, and a year later Donna did the same.",

  "Mom and Dad, Barb and Jere and their growing boys, Ethel and Noah and their two kids, Henry and Natalie and their rowdy sons.",
  "They took over bedrooms and pitched tents in the grassy backyard.",
  "They worked together during the day and sat around a campfire at night, talking and laughing and remembering.",

  "Janet stayed for almost a year.",

  "From then on, the ranch they called the Last Best Place became a haven for the women who’d served in Vietnam.",
  "They came, they stayed as long as they needed to, and they moved on.",
  "Each left an imprint somehow, a path for women like them to follow.",
  "They left art and easels and paints.",
  "Knitting needles and skeins of wool, short stories and memoir chapters and musical instruments.",
  "They worked during the day—hammering nails, painting walls, feeding horses, tending the garden.",
  "Whatever needed doing.",

  "They learned to breathe, and then to talk, and then, if they were lucky, to hope.",
  "Frankie taught them the healing power of words and the joy of finding quiet.",
  "Peace, at least the beginning of it, was the goal.",
  "But it was never easy.",
  "",
  "The beautiful, unexpected by-product of helping other women was that Frankie found her own passion again, her own pride.",
  "She loved this place fiercely, loved the life she’d forged in the wilderness, loved the women who came to her for help and helped her in return.",
  "She woke up each morning with hope.",
  "And each summer, her friends and family showed up to spend as much vacation time as possible on the ranch.",

  "Donna came up beside her.",
  "In the years they’d worked together, both women had filled out, gotten physically strong by pounding fence posts and hauling hay bales and tossing saddles up on their horses’ backs.",
  "Both routinely wore Levi’s, cowboy boots, and flannel shirts; no shoulder pads or power suits in this part of Montana.",

  "At the Mall, an American flag fluttered in the cool breeze above a trio of bright red fire trucks.",
  "Supporters filled the grassy area, lined the Reflecting Pool, waited for the parade of veterans: children on their parents’ shoulders, families huddled together, mothers holding framed pictures of their lost sons, dogs barking, babies screaming.",

  "A man’s voice rang out.",
  "“No one can debate the sacrifice and the service of those who fell while serving … Standing before this monument, we see reflected in a dark mirror dimly a chance now to let go of the pain, the grief, the resentment, the bitterness, the guilt…”",

  "As the speech went on, the speaker remarked on the world the veterans had come home to and the shame now felt by Americans who hadn’t welcomed their soldiers home.",
  "At last, the speaker said the words that Frankie and her fellow veterans had waited for all these years: “Welcome home and thank you.”",
  "The soldier next to Frankie began to cry.",

  "Their family and the visitors joined in.",

  "Someone else stepped up to the podium.",
  "A grizzled, old-before-his-time vet in stained fatigues.",

  "Reporters and cameramen pushed through the crowd, seeking statements for the nightly news.",

  "Frankie drifted down the sloping grass, drawn to the Wall.",
  "She saw women holding framed photographs of the men they’d lost, and a teenager wearing his father’s too-big dress uniform.",
  "",
  "As she neared the mirror of black granite, she saw her own reflection—a skinny, long-haired woman in fatigues and a boonie hat—superimposed over the names of the fallen.",

  "She turned.",

  "The man who’d tapped her shoulder was maybe her age, with long sideburns and a straggly beard.",

  "Frankie held up a hand for silence.",
  "For once, her father complied.",

  "The soldier reached out to hold her hand, stared into her eyes.",
  "In that moment, on the Mall ground, with the Wall shining beside them, the two of them shared it all—the horror, the grief, the pain, the pride, the guilt, the camaraderie.",
  "She thought, Here we are, for the first time since the war, all of us together.",
  "",
  "“Thank you, ma’am,” he said, and she nodded and let him go.",

  "",
  "“You think I feel guilty for urging my son to go to war?",

  "Frankie drew in a sharp breath.",
  "How long had she waited to hear those words from him?",

  "Tears blurred her vision.",

  "",
  "Peanut.",
  "God, he hadn’t called her that in years.",
  "",
  "Frankie saw him crying and wished she knew the perfect words to say, but nothing came to her.",
  "Life was like that, she guessed; it was all wrong until suddenly it was right, and you didn’t really know how to react in either instance.",
  "But she knew love when she saw it, and it filled her.",
  "“I don’t know about heroism,” she said.",
  "“But I saw a lot of it.",
  "And…” She drew in a deep breath.",
  "“I’m proud of my service, Dad.",

  "She left her parents standing in front of Finley’s name, and walked along the Wall, looking for 1967–1969, seeing the flowers and pictures and yearbooks that were being set up at the base of the black granite.",

  "He pulled her into his arms, whispering, “McGrath,” again, into her ear.",

  "Lebih dari satu dekade setelah mereka dimakamkan tanpa upacara dan dilupakan oleh sesama warga Amerika?",
  "",
  "Sekeras apa pun Frankie bekerja dalam delapan tahun terakhir, dan ia memang telah mendedikasikan diri pada usaha itu, ia tidak pernah benar-benar mampu menghilangkan rasa malu yang dibuat oleh sesama warga Amerika atas pengabdiannya di Vietnam, maupun kemarahannya pada bagaimana pemerintah memperlakukan para veteran yang kembali dengan tubuh, pikiran, atau jiwa yang hancur.",
  "Lebih buruk dari itu, pada akhir tahun tujuh puluhan ia duduk di ruang tamunya ini dan menonton seorang sesama veteran Vietnam mengklaim di televisi bahwa Agen Oranye telah memberinya—dan ribuan orang sepertinya—kanker.",
  "Aku mati di Vietnam; aku hanya belum menyadarinya, katanya.",
  "Tak lama setelah itu, dunia mengetahui bahwa herbisida tersebut juga menyebabkan keguguran dan cacat lahir.",

  "It has taken me decades to circle back to the Vietnam War era.",
  "",
  "I was young, in elementary or middle school, for the majority of the war, but I remember it vividly: the protests, the darkening tone of the nightly news, the arc of the story told by the media, more and more young men dying, and most of all, how the veterans—many of them my friends’ fathers—were treated when they came home.",
  "All of it made a lasting impression.",

  "Not enough has been made or recorded or remembered about their service.",
  "It is even difficult to get certain agreed-upon numbers of the women who served in Vietnam.",
  "According to the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation statement, approximately 10,000 American military women were stationed in Vietnam during the war.",
  "Most were nurses in the Army, Air Force, and Navy, but women also served as physicians and medical personnel, and in air traffic control and military intelligence.",
  "Civilian women also served in Vietnam as news correspondents and workers for the Red Cross, Donut Dollies, the USO, Special Services, the American Friends Service Committee, Catholic Relief Services, and other humanitarian organizations.",
